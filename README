Supplementary Information for the article An Gong et al. The steering gaits of sperm. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 2019

This repository contains the scripts and tracking data to analyse the flagellar beat of human and sea urchin sperm:

The Jupyter notebooks run with Python 3.6 and 3.7 kernels. All additional packages are specified in the requierments.txt

data/   Raw data of sperm beat patterns
nb/     Jupyter notebooks to analyse and generate plots

To regenerate the data of the respective species run:
- process several human
- process several sea

And finally regenerate the plots via:
- Spectrogram

Numerical calculation of the rotation velocity of head-less sperm with different harmonic contributions is done with the MATLAB software SolvingEquations.m
